# Campus-wide-Student-Identification-Access-Control-on-WLAN-
Wireless solutions are often the perfect answer for facilities with expansive acreage and remote sites, where hard-wiring, security and network equipment can be prohibitively expensive.  In such scenarios we can integrate wireless access control.Any interruption in the network is dangerous and requires denial of service(DOS) by implementing Firewall.A pre-defined Access Control List (ACL) is configured over the router interface, either inbound or outbound.This list is compared to the in flowing or out flowing traffic of router and based on the decision the traffic is filtered to the destination(host). Our implementation of this project is for student identification in a campus wide network.
